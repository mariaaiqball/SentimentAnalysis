"Dunkin Donuts is a fascinating business. 

Coffee &amp; bagels are so mid. 

Employees make your order wrong 65% of the time. 

Counter staff typically has an attitude. 

Stores usually need a deep clean. 

Yes, Starbucks is making 20x what Dunks is making…but Dunkin is still doing",positive
